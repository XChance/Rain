# Rain
Simple program, written in Java. Emulates rain. Inspired by Daniel Shiffman. 

Controls:
Z, X, and C keys change the Rain's color. 
Numbers 1 - 4 on the keyboard change the background color. 
Spacebar will make the rain change to random colors that shift every 12 ticks.

I recommend mixing different background and rain colors if you choose to play around with this.
